            <h3>Color Schema</h3>

            <p>I will be using for the header a very deep blue, while in the middle I will be using a clear green. For
                the letters I will be using white and black, depending where it fits the best</p>

            <p>I choose this colors because remebered me about Perez Zeledon, they might not be the same always,
                however, Perez is a place that is sourrounded by mountains, and a few minutes drive you can be in the
                beatiful beachs that Costa Rica has, that's why I choose them.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The color codes for now would be the following:</p>

            <p>Deep Blue: #1B4242. This one would be use for the header and footer.</p>

            <p>Clear Green: #99BC85. This one is going to be use for the "main" section of the web.</p>

            <p>White & Black: #fff & #000. These ones would be use for the letters, depending where they are</p>

            <table class="colors">
                <tr>
                    <th>Headers</th>
                    <th>Body</th>
                    <th>Letter 1</th>
                    <th>Letter 2</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td class="headers">[#1B4242]</td>
                    <td class="bodies">[#99BC85]</td>
                    <td class="letter-one">[#000]</td>
                    <td class="letter-two">[#FFF]</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        </section>

        <section class="card">
            <h3>Typography</h3>

            <p>For the fonts I will be sticking to something classic such as "Raleway" and "Rubrik" are.</p>

            <br>

            <p>For the headers of all kinds I will be using Rubrik, which provides a cool and easy font to read, while
                for the body. paragraphs I will be using Raleway, I choose this one because is tiny and can provide a
                better experience to the reader</p>
